Created for the MSOE Residence Hall Association Logo Contest. Won on January 6th, 2022. There are several variations of the logo created for many use cases.   
- RHA Logo, the generic one to be used in most cases
- Letterhead, to be used on letters, stamps, or situations where the audience might not be familiar with the acronyms RHA or MSOE.
- Letterhead 2, to be used on letters, stamps, or situations where the audience might not be familiar with the acronyms RHA or MSOE. Interchangable but should be consistent.
- Outline, to be used when printing in black and white, or when the normal logo does not show up clearly on designs. Can be used in place of the default logo.
- RHA Logo Extra Small, only to be used when the text on the normal logo would be too small to be legible ie. website favicon, Discord role icon, etc.

EPS files are used in Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, and by some merch companies   

SVG files are most commonly used by web browsers   

EMF files are 32 bit vector files used by Microsoft programs including Office and Windows, introduced in 1992 with Windows 3.1   

PNG files are losslessly compressed bitmap files - they are the most widely compatible with programs but have a fixed resolution   

The Additional Graphics folder contains things like the Facebook Banner and background textures for use when making posters or documents.
