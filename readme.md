**File Type Notes:**   
EPS files are used in Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, and by some merch companies   

SVG files are most commonly used by web browsers   

EMF files are 32 bit vector files used by Microsoft programs including Office and Windows, introduced in 1992 with Windows 3.1   

PNG files are losslessly compressed bitmap files - they are the most widely compatible with programs but have a fixed resolution   

The Additional Graphics folder contains things like the Facebook Banner and background textures for use when making posters or documents.
